## System Architecture

### 1. Camera Simulation Layer

The simulation layer uses Gazebo and ROS to create virtual RealSense D435 cameras:

- **RealSense D435 Model**: Simulated using URDF/Xacro with accurate physical and optical properties.
- **ArUco Marker**: Attached to the back of camera 2 for calibration purposes.
- **Gazebo Plugins**: Used to generate RGB and depth images from the simulated cameras.
- **Camera Topics**:
  - `/camera1/rgb/image_raw` - RGB image from camera 1
  - `/camera1/depth/image_raw` - Depth image from camera 1
  - `/camera2/rgb/image_raw` - RGB image from camera 2
  - `/camera2/depth/image_raw` - Depth image from camera 2

### 2. Camera Calibration Layer

The calibration layer establishes the spatial relationship between cameras:

- **ArUco Detection**: Detects the marker attached to camera 2 in the view of camera 1.
- **Transform Calculation**: Computes the transform from camera 1 to camera 2.
- **TF Broadcasting**: Publishes the calculated transform to the ROS TF tree.
- **Key Components**:
  - `camera_calibration_node` - Performs the calibration using detected ArUco markers.
  - `/aruco_detector` - Detects ArUco markers in the camera 1 view.

### 3. Point Cloud Processing Layer

The processing layer filters and enhances the point clouds:

- **Point Cloud Generation**: Converts depth images to 3D point clouds.
- **Filtering Pipeline**:
  1. PassThrough Filter: Removes points beyond specified depth range.
  2. VoxelGrid Filter: Downsamples the point cloud for efficiency.
  3. Statistical Outlier Removal: Eliminates noise and outliers.
- **Point Cloud Fusion**: Combines the filtered point clouds into a unified view.
- **Key Components**:
  - `point_cloud_filter_node` - Applies filtering pipeline to each camera's point cloud.
  - `point_cloud_merger_node` - Combines filtered point clouds into a unified cloud.

### 4. Visualization Layer

The visualization layer provides user interfaces:

- **RViz Interface**: Displays the camera models, point clouds, and TF frames.
- **Diagnostic Tools**:
  - `visualize_calibration.py` - Shows calibration transform details.
  - `evaluate_pointcloud.py` - Analyzes point cloud quality and fusion results.

## Calibration Algorithm

The calibration process follows these steps:

1. Camera 1 detects the ArUco marker attached to camera 2
2. The position and orientation of the marker in camera 1's frame is determined
3. The known transform from the marker to camera 2 is used (defined in the URDF)
4. The transform from camera 1 to camera 2 is computed as:
   ```
   T_camera1_camera2 = T_camera1_marker * T_marker_camera2
   ```
5. This transform is published to the TF tree for other nodes to use

## Point Cloud Fusion Algorithm

The point cloud fusion process follows these steps:

1. Both point clouds are transformed into a common reference frame (base_link)
2. The transformed point clouds are combined into a single cloud
3. A VoxelGrid filter is applied to the merged cloud to eliminate duplicate points
4. The filtered merged cloud is published for visualization and further processing

## Performance Considerations

- **Computational Requirements**: 
  - CPU: 4+ cores recommended
  - RAM: 8GB+ recommended
  - GPU: Recommended for real-time performance

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Point cloud downsampling reduces computational load
  - Filter parameters can be tuned for performance vs. quality tradeoffs
  - Reducing camera resolution improves performance at cost of detail

## Extension and Customization

The system is designed for easy extension and customization:

1. **Adding More Cameras**: 
   - Add new camera definitions to the URDF model
   - Update the calibration node to handle multiple camera transforms

2. **Custom Filtering Pipeline**:
   - Modify `point_cloud_filter_node.cpp` to add or replace filters
   - Update the parameter configuration in YAML files

3. **Alternative Calibration Methods**:
   - Replace ArUco detection with other methods (checkerboard, AprilTag)
   - Implement ICP or other point cloud registration methods in a new node
